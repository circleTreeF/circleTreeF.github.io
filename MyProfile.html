                <li>
                    <b>One journal paper is expected for this research project.</b>
                </li>
                <li>Conformal predictors are useful algorithms for making predictions with confidence by predicting sets
                    of
                    values
                    rather than making point predictions. They have the property that they are reliable to some
                    user-defined
                    confidence level, so long as data is independent and identically distributed (iid). These algorithms
                    would split
                    the samples data into 3 data sets, the proper training set, the calibration set and the testing set.
                </li>
                <li>However, in the real world cases, the size of the available data set may be too limited to split
                    into
                    three
                    significant data sets. This
                    leads to the research challenges in two directions: (1) to ensure that their predictions are
                    optimally
                    efficient, (2) since inductive conformal predictor require three
                    independent data sets, proper training, calibration and testing, how best to manage the allocation
                    of
                    data to
                    those three
                    sets whilst maintaining the reliability property.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This research project addresses those problems with the target
                    to provide
                    a modified version of conformal predictor by overlapping the proper training set and the calibration
                    set
                    and
                    recommendations on their use.
