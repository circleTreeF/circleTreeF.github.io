                    Science.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One journal paper is expected to be published for this research project
                </li>
                <li>Using Python, Numpy and Ski-kit learn, with experiments and statistics analysis, this research
                    project addresses the problems to provide a modified version of the conformal predictor by
                    overlapping the proper training set and the calibration set and recommendations on their use.
                </li>
                <li>Conformal predictors are useful algorithms for making predictions with confidence by predicting sets
                    of values rather than making point predictions. They have the property that they are reliable to
                    some
                    user-defined confidence level, so long as data is independent and identically distributed (iid).
                    These algorithms
                    would split the samples data into 3 data sets, the proper training set, the calibration set and the
                    testing set.
                </li>
                <li>However, in the real world cases, the size of the available data set may be too limited to split
                    into
                    three
                    significant data sets. This
                    leads to the research challenges in two directions: (1) to ensure that their predictions are
                    optimally
                    efficient, (2) since inductive conformal predictor require three
                    independent data sets, proper training, calibration and testing, how best to manage the allocation
                    of
                    data to
                    those three
                    sets whilst maintaining the reliability property.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This research project addresses those problems with the target
                    to provide
                    a modified version of conformal predictor by overlapping the proper training set and the calibration
                    set
                    and
                    recommendations on their use.
